## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Started the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file with "Allows to
  forecast" instead of the previous "This package allows".

* In the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file I have added a DOI 
  reference to a paper where the method implemented in the package is
  explained as suggested by the CRAN mantainer.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04.05 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
